# This is a TipOfTheDay tips file.
# Keep each tip on one line.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# You can use these macros in the text:
#	<CR>: 		insert a linefeed
#	<URL>: 		is followed by a URL link
#	<UDESC>: 	is followed by a URL description
#
# Usage syntax (the text of the tip is <tip_text>):
#	( <tip_text> | <CR> )* [ <URL>text [ <UDESC>text ] ]
#
# Example tip:
#	...some tip<CR><CR>more lines...<URL>http://www.bloodshed.net/dev<UDESC>Click to visit Bloodshed Software
#
# More macros will be added as needed...
#
# Note1: if you want to use an ampersand (&), put two together (&&).
# Note2: each tip can have no more than 255 chars.
# Note3: the macro <CR> counts as one character, not four.
# Note4: with macros <URL> and <UDESC>, the rest of the line is not displayed as a tip,
#	 so it does not count for the 255-chars limit.
# Note5: Macro <UDESC> is optional. If ommited, <URL> will be printed as the link.
# Note6: Macro <UDESC> if exists *must* follow the macro <URL>
